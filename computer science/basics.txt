programmin languages:
* primative constructs
** literal constructs
*** 3.14
** infix operators: +-*/

a = 3.14 * 5

= is assignment

a = 5
a = a + 2 (works because a is defined)


Errors:
* syntax
** a + 2 = 5 (can only be one variable a = 5)

* semantic Errors (the program does not do what you want)
**
